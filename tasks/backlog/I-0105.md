# I-0105 — Load testing harness (orders + WS) + regression thresholds

## Goal
Create repeatable load tests and block regressions before launch.

## Scope
- Order placement/cancel TPS scenarios
- WS connections and message fan-out scenarios
- Report p50/p99 + error rate + resource usage

## Acceptance Criteria
- Baseline captured and stored
- CI can run a smaller smoke load
- Release gate includes full load report

## Tests
- Load tests on staging cluster
- Failure injection while under load

## Observability
- Metrics: load_tps, p99, error rate
- Dashboards for capacity planning

## Rollback / Recovery
- If regression detected, rollback release or revert change and rerun

## Dependencies
- B-0202
- I-0102
