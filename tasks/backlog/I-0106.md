# I-0106 — DR rehearsal: backup/restore + replay

## Goal
Prove RPO/RTO targets via rehearsal and document steps.

## Scope
- Postgres backup + restore
- ClickHouse backup (optional)
- Trading Core snapshot/WAL restore
- Kafka offset replay for settlement

## Acceptance Criteria
- Restore succeeds in staging
- Settlement replay reconstitutes balances and passes invariants
- Time taken measured and meets target

## Tests
- Full rehearsal runbook test
- Random failure during restore test

## Observability
- Metrics: restore_time_ms, replay_time_ms

## Rollback / Recovery
- If rehearsal fails, block launch and fix tooling; no exceptions

## Dependencies
- B-0111
- B-0304
- RUNBOOK.md
