# B-0305 — Ledger invariants guard + auto safety policy hooks

## Goal
Detect invariant violations and trigger safety actions (halt withdrawals, throttle trading).

## Scope
- Periodic invariant checks
- Reconciliation gap checks
- Emit alerts and (optional) admin action suggestions

## Acceptance Criteria
- Any invariant violation triggers SEV1 workflow
- Clear, actionable alert messages with remediation pointers

## Tests
- Unit: invariant evaluation
- Integration: forced violation triggers alarm

## Observability
- Metrics: invariant_violation_total, reconciliation_gap
- Logs: audit event on triggers

## Rollback / Recovery
- If guard is noisy, adjust thresholds but never disable without change control

## Dependencies
- B-0304
