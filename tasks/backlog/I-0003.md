# I-0003 — Local dev compose: Postgres + Redpanda + Redis + ClickHouse + MinIO + OTel

## Goal
Provide a reproducible local environment for end-to-end flows.

## Scope
- Add `infra/compose/docker-compose.yml`
- Services: postgres, redpanda, redis, clickhouse, minio, otel-collector, prometheus, grafana (optional)
- Network + volumes + healthchecks

## Acceptance Criteria
- `docker compose up -d` succeeds on a clean machine
- Healthchecks pass within reasonable time
- Services are reachable via localhost ports documented

## Tests
- Smoke tests: connect to each service
- Integration: produce/consume a test topic

## Observability
- Dashboard: local OTel collector receives traces
- Metrics: broker up, db up

## Rollback / Recovery
- If compose breaks, revert changes and restore last known-good compose

## Dependencies
- I-0001
