# B-0306 — Engine↔Ledger coverage reconciliation v1

## Goal
Continuously verify that every executed trade seq is settled into the ledger, and detect gaps fast.

## Scope
- Track last_engine_seq per symbol (from core checkpoints)
- Track last_settled_seq per symbol (ledger consumer)
- Gap detection + alerts + safety policy hooks

## Acceptance Criteria
- Persistent gap triggers SEV workflow
- Auto recommendations: replay from offset / throttle/halt

## Tests
- Integration: inject missing event and ensure gap detection
- Verify recovery closes gap

## Observability
- Metrics: reconciliation_gap, gap_age_ms

## Rollback / Recovery
- If gap cannot be resolved quickly, set symbol to SOFT_HALT and investigate

## Dependencies
- B-0302
- B-0305
