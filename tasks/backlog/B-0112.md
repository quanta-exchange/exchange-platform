# B-0112 — Leader election + fencing token (split-brain defense)

## Goal
Ensure only one active engine can commit events per symbol partition.

## Scope
- Lease-based leadership (consensus-backed)
- Fencing token monotonic; required to publish/commit
- Standby read-only mode

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dual leader cannot publish commits
- Failover proceeds with correct fencing token
- Operational commands documented

## Tests
- Split-brain simulation test
- Network partition scenario test

## Observability
- Metrics: leader_state, fencing_token
- Alert: duplicate seq or conflicting leader state

## Rollback / Recovery
- If leadership uncertain, HARD_HALT affected symbols and investigate

## Dependencies
- B-0111
