# B-0201 — Edge Gateway REST v1 (orders + status)

## Goal
Implement external REST API surface with auth, idempotency and tracing.

## Scope
- Endpoints: POST /v1/orders, DELETE /v1/orders/{id}, GET /v1/orders/{id}
- Auth (API key + signature) + replay protection
- Idempotency-Key required for POST/DELETE
- Trace/Request IDs

## Acceptance Criteria
- API responses include seq and timestamps
- Idempotent retries return same result
- Rate limiting enforced

## Tests
- Integration tests with Trading Core stub
- Security tests: signature invalid, timestamp skew

## Observability
- Metrics: http_latency, http_errors, ratelimit_dropped
- Traces: edge spans include user_id hash

## Rollback / Recovery
- If auth change breaks clients, support dual auth for limited time or rollback

## Dependencies
- B-0101
