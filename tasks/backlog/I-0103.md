# I-0103 — GitOps with ArgoCD (dev/staging/prod)

## Goal
Make deployments auditable and consistent across environments.

## Scope
- ArgoCD projects/apps
- Env overlays (values) and promotion flow
- Sync policies and manual gates for prod

## Acceptance Criteria
- Deployments come only from GitOps repo state
- Rollback is git revert + sync

## Tests
- Dry-run apply validations
- Simulated rollback test

## Observability
- Metrics: sync status, drift detected

## Rollback / Recovery
- If GitOps misconfig causes outage, pause sync and revert offending change

## Dependencies
- I-0101
