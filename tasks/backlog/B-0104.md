# B-0104 — Risk hot-path v1 (reserve + limits + price band guard)

## Goal
Prevent overspending and protect against extreme prices before entering the matching loop.

## Scope
- Reserve check integration (available/hold)
- Rate/risk limits per user and per symbol
- Price band / circuit guard based on ref price

## Acceptance Criteria
- Overspend impossible at engine accept stage
- Price band rejects with PRICE_BAND
- Limits configurable and auditable

## Tests
- Unit: reserve math
- Property: no negative balances in simulated flows
- Golden: price band scenarios

## Observability
- Metrics: risk_reject_total, band_violation_rate
- Logs: reject reason codes

## Rollback / Recovery
- Disable risk feature flags (safe mode) only with admin approval; otherwise rollback

## Dependencies
- B-0103
