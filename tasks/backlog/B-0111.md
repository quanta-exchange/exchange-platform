# B-0111 — Snapshotting v1 + fast recovery

## Goal
Reduce recovery time by snapshotting book state and replaying WAL tail.

## Scope
- Snapshot format includes last_seq and integrity hash
- Apply snapshot + replay WAL from last_seq
- Snapshot frequency configuration

## Acceptance Criteria
- Restart recovery time meets target for N symbols
- Snapshot+WAL yields exact same state hash as before crash

## Tests
- Snapshot correctness tests
- Crash during snapshot test
- Determinism replay test

## Observability
- Metrics: snapshot_duration_ms, recovery_time_ms

## Rollback / Recovery
- If snapshot causes pauses, increase interval or disable temporarily; rely on WAL replay

## Dependencies
- B-0110
