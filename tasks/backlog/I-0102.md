# I-0102 — OpenTelemetry end-to-end tracing

## Goal
Standardize tracing and correlation across all services.

## Scope
- OTel SDK config for Go/Kotlin
- Trading Core emits trace_id/correlation fields
- Collector pipeline + exemplars

## Acceptance Criteria
- A single order traces edge→core→kafka→ledger
- Sampling rules documented

## Tests
- Integration test: trace appears with expected spans
- Verify logs include trace_id

## Observability
- Metrics: traces_received, dropped_spans
- Dashboards for trace latency

## Rollback / Recovery
- If tracing overhead too high, adjust sampling but keep correlation IDs

## Dependencies
- I-0003
