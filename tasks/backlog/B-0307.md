# B-0307 — Corrections workflow v1 (reversal/adjustment + 2-person approval)

## Goal
Implement safe correction mechanics without mutating historical ledger rows.

## Scope
- Correction request model (who/why/ticket)
- Two-person approval in admin API (or manual process for Launch-1)
- Reversal/adjustment entry generation with linkage to original entries

## Acceptance Criteria
- No direct ledger updates/deletes
- Correction records fully auditable
- Balance impact visible and traceable

## Tests
- Unit tests for reversal generation
- Integration: correction changes balance and preserves invariants

## Observability
- Metrics: corrections_total, correction_pending_age

## Rollback / Recovery
- If correction incorrect, apply subsequent correction (never mutate history)

## Dependencies
- B-0301
