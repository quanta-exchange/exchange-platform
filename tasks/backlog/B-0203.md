# B-0203 — Market data cache v1 (Redis hot snapshots)

## Goal
Store hot orderbook/ticker/candle snapshots for fast REST/WS recovery.

## Scope
- Redis schema for snapshots (per symbol, per channel)
- TTL and size caps
- Snapshot write path from Kafka consumers

## Acceptance Criteria
- REST snapshot endpoints serve from Redis with fallback
- Snapshot is consistent with seq and can seed deltas

## Tests
- Integration tests with Redis
- Snapshot+delta reconstruction tests

## Observability
- Metrics: redis_hit_rate, snapshot_write_latency

## Rollback / Recovery
- If Redis fails, degrade to history endpoints and reduce WS features

## Dependencies
- B-0202
