- Publish TickerUpdated events and cache in Redis

## Acceptance Criteria
- Ticker matches clickhouse query results within tolerance
- Handles restarts and reprocessing safely

## Tests
- Integration tests with test stream
- Backfill test from history

## Observability
- Metrics: ticker_lag_ms, window_state_size

## Rollback / Recovery
- If window state grows, tune state backend and checkpointing; rollback if instability

## Dependencies
