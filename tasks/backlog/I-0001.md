# I-0001 — Monorepo skeleton + docs baseline

## Goal
Create the initial repository structure and commit baseline docs + ticket system.

## Scope
- Add top-level docs: Plans/Architecture/API Surface/Runbook
- Add tasks/backlog convention
- Add minimal folder tree placeholders for services/streaming/infra/contracts

## Acceptance Criteria
- Repo builds/opens cleanly in IntelliJ
- Docs exist at repo root
- `tasks/backlog/` contains at least the initial backlog set

## Tests
- Manual: open in IntelliJ, ensure no indexing explosion
- Lint markdown formatting (optional)

## Observability
- N/A (docs)
- Ensure consistent ticket naming

## Rollback / Recovery
- If structure wrong, revert the commit and re-apply corrected layout
