# I-0108 — Safety-case generator (evidence bundle) for release gates

## Goal
Generate a release artifact proving correctness and operational readiness.

## Scope
- Collect: golden test reports, property tests, load tests, chaos drills
- Include git commit, build metadata, config versions
- Store artifact in S3 with integrity hash

## Acceptance Criteria
- `make safety-case` produces artifact for every release candidate
- Gate blocks if missing or failed

## Tests
- Verify artifact generation on CI
- Tamper check test

## Observability
- Metrics: safety_case_last_success_ts

## Rollback / Recovery
- If generator fails, block release until fixed

## Dependencies
- I-0105
- I-0106
