# I-0107 — Production access control: RBAC + JIT + audit logging

## Goal
Reduce insider risk by enforcing least-privilege and auditing all sensitive actions.

## Scope
- RBAC roles for prod
- JIT access workflow (time-limited)
- Session recording (where possible)
- Audit log pipeline to immutable store

## Acceptance Criteria
- No permanent prod write access for individuals
- All admin actions have actor+reason+ticket

## Tests
- Access review drill
- Attempt unauthorized action test

## Observability
- Metrics: prod_access_grants, unauthorized_attempts

## Rollback / Recovery
- If compromise suspected, revoke access immediately and rotate credentials

## Dependencies
- I-0103
- I-0104
